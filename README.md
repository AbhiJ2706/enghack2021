## Brief Overview of application

PIGGYBANK lets kids save their money in an online PiggyBank, while tracking total online savings and seeing their money grow through rewards. As kids find items they want to buy, they can use their bank account to make Parent-approved purchases in online shopping on Amazon.

## Inspiration

Welcome to **_PiggyBank_**! Our application encourages kids to save and invest their money, while securely buying their favourite toys straight from home, with secure Parental approval for each purchase.

The COVID-19 pandemic has doubled e-commerce sales in the last year (Global News). While online purchases have become a norm for the average adult, children are often less trusted by their parents for online shopping. Our application bridges the gap between children's access to secure online shopping, along with encouraging money saving strategies.

PIGGYBANK is a no-risk bank- no money leaves a parent's hand unless they approve.

The application has a **full login account system** for kids to log in and start their banking journey. 

### Kids can:
- Securely log in and log out of their account.
- Track savings and money given from parents.
- **Browse Toys in the Marketplace for budget purchases.**
    - Marketplace **web-scraps** the newest toys from online and gives price ranges for purchases.
- Request to buy items on Amazon online shopping, **with secure Parental approval**.
    - **Sends purchase approval emails** to Parents for them to confirm to buy the item(s).
- Track and receive monthly allowances.
- Receive achievements for saving money.
- See account money grow through investment rewards.
- Track previously bought items
- Receive badge achievements for certain tasks and milestones

### Adults can:
- Confirm or deny purchase requests from kids through **email**.
- Add and remove money from kid's account.
- Change monthly allowance given to kids.
- Open kid's preferred products from application Marketplace on Amazon.

### Additional features:
- Cookies allow the user to **automatically sign in when visiting the website again** (using a _remember username and password_ feature for easy access by kids).
- Each page checks if the user is signed in to confirm that no one can access other pages without accounts logged in.
- Amazon links of kid's preferred products are converted to **affiliate links** for our business growth and revenue (i.e. generate money for our business).
- Amazon links automatically add items to cart easily for purchase.
- Robust app platform that simulates a real-world product application.

## How we built it

We built PiggyBank using the MERN (Mongoose, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. We used Mongoose to store user data, Node.js and Express.js to build the server which would get and send user information, handle purchase requests, and scrape amazon, and we used React.js for the frontend. We also used Material UI to style the website.

## Challenges we ran into

Lots and lots of merge conflicts, otherwise no major challenges!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Working as a team on the same GitHub repo (first time using GitHub properly for some teammates), getting all the features we wanted implemented to work, and getting smaller mechanics for more niche interactions such as denying page access when users aren't logged in. 

## What we learned

Abhi- Lots more about React and Node.js than I knew before, and how to use Mongoose!
Robert- Git
Picowchew- More libraries and functionality in React
Ishan- Git

## What's next for PiggyBank

More products, adding children under a single profile, more achievements, and other feature upgrades!
